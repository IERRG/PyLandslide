The "generate" command
-----------------------
This command is used to generate a susceptibility raster layer using based on an input sensitivity CSV file generated using the
``sensitivity`` command and the index of the desired trial for raster generation. The resulting raster file is saved into the output
directory and uses the index as a name suffix.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide generate --help

This results in the following, including three inputs:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide generate [OPTIONS]

        Generate a landslide hazard layer based on a sensitivity trial.

    Options:
        -f, --file-name TEXT        JSON file containing the sensitivity config.
        -c, --csv-sensitivity TEXT  CSV file of the sensitivity results.
        -i, --index INTEGER         Index of the desired trail.
        --help                      Show this message and exit.

To use the ``generate`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide generate -f  json_file.json -c sensitivity_results.csv -i 0

Further details on the structure and inputs to the JSON file are in the `Tutorials Section <https://ierrg.github.io/PyLandslide/tutorial.html#generating-susceptibility-raster-layer>`_.
