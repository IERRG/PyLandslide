The "compare" command
----------------------
This command is used to compare two susceptibility raster layers by calculating the percentage area within each susceptibility class
and generating a raster layer of the difference between the two input layers.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide compare --help

This results in the following, including three inputs:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide compare [OPTIONS]

        Compare two landslide hazard raster file.

    Options:
        -f, --file-name TEXT  JSON file containing the sensitivity config.
        -l1, --layer1 TEXT    First landslide hazard raster file.
        -l2, --layer2 TEXT    Second landslide hazard raster file.
        --help                Show this message and exit.

To use the ``compare`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide compare -f json_file.json -l1 layer1.tif -l2 layer2.tif

Further details on the structure and inputs to the JSON file are in the `Tutorials Section <https://shesp-lab.github.io/PyLandslide/tutorial.html#comparing-two-susceptibility-raster-layer>`_.
