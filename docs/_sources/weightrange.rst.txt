The "weightrange" command
--------------------------
This uses Random Forest Classification Machine Learning Models to estimate weight ranges of the factors contributing
to the occurrence of landslides. The data required for this method are provided and loaded from a JSON-based document.
The results are written to a CSV file specified in the JSON-based document.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide weightrange --help

This results in the following, including three inputs:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide weightrange [OPTIONS]

        Determine weight range based on ML.

    Options:
        -f, --file-name TEXT  JSON file containing the weight range config.
        --help                Show this message and exit.

To use the ``compare`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide weightrange -f json_file.json

Further details on the structure and inputs to the JSON file are in the `Tutorials Section <https://ierrg.github.io/PyLandslide/tutorial.html>`_.
