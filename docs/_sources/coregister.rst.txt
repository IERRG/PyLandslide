The "coregister" command
-------------------------
This command converts raster files of the factors contributing to the occurrence of landslides to uint8 to reduce their size, and then
co-registers them to ensure that all rasters are aligned, have the same resolution, and same array dimensions.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide coregister --help

This results in the following, including one input:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide coregister [OPTIONS]

        Align raster data before using them.

    Options:
        -f, --folder-name TEXT  Folder containing the raster data.
        --help                  Show this message and exit.

To use the ``coregister`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide coregister -f raster_data

The resulting co-registered rasters are saved into a folder named ``raster_data/alinged_rasters``.
