The "sensitivity" command
--------------------------
This command is used to perform a sensitivity analysis based on a CSV file of weight ranges generated using the ``weightrange``
command, and the number of desired sensitivity trials. The command creates a CSV file in the output folder containing the
sensitivity analysis results.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide sensitivity --help

This results in the following, including three inputs:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide sensitivity [OPTIONS]

        Sensitivity of landslide hazard to weight uncertainty.

    Options:
        -f, --file-name TEXT  JSON file containing the sensitivity config.
        -t, --trials INTEGER  Number of sensitivity trials.
        --help                Show this message and exit.

To use the ``sensitivity`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide sensitivity -f json_file.json -t 5

Further details on the structure and inputs to the JSON file are in the `Tutorials Section <https://ierrg.github.io/PyLandslide/tutorial.html>`_.
