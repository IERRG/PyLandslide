The "mldata" command
-----------------------
This command is used to extract the factor values at the landslide and non-landslide locations. These locations are obtained from a
shapefiles provided in a JSON-based document. The results are saved into features.csv (factor values) and targets.csv
(landslide or non-landslide status) in the output directory specified in the JSON-based document.

For help on the inputs of this command, run the following:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide mldata --help

This results in the following, including three inputs:

.. code-block:: console

    Usage: PyLandslide mldata [OPTIONS]

        Prepare features and targets data for ML.

    Options:
        -f, --file-name TEXT  JSON file containing the data preparation config.
        --help                Show this message and exit.

To use the ``mldata`` command, run the following and make sure to replace the inputs based on your case:

.. code-block:: console

    PyLandslide mldata -f  json_file.json

Further details on the structure and inputs to the JSON file are in the `Tutorials Section <https://ierrg.github.io/PyLandslide/tutorial.html>`_.
